# Basic AI Agent

Can accept basic coding tasks using a set of predetermined functions like scanning a file directory, reading/overwriting a file's contents, and executing the Python interpreter on a file. Requires Python3.10+ and uv. Simply run on the command line 'uv run main.py "{your command here}"'. (e.g. uv run main.py "fix my calculator app, its not starting correctly")
